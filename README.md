-------------------------------------------------

This is a surface and curve editor tailored for ultrasonic phased array mid-air haptic parameter control. The editor can be used to design a function mapping the relationship between one or two user-defined input parameters and a phased array output parameter.

### Use
The editor can be used on its own from [Editor/index.html](Editor/index.html), or it can be used in an external software interfacing with [ParameterEditor.js](ParameterEditor.js).
